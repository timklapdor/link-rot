### Just how boring is the iPhone?

We discuss just how boring is Apple? Why is there this expectation around innovation? Is the same expectation placed on Samsung, Microsoft and Google? What's the last bit of tech that actually made you excited? And **should** tech actually make you excited or are our lives just that sad?

### What does dying look like today?

In todays digital age what exactly does death look like today? Should we build computers that forget? Could we set timelines for data to die or fade? What happens when an algorithm has access to our memories? Is somones social media page a memorial or does it stop us from moving on?
