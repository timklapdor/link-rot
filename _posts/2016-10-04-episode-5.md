### Learning for Free

The internet is apparently the greatest store of free and open knowledge in human history. So how do we use it to learn? How can we harness the vast swathes of information available at our fingertips to teach ourselves about the world? Can we channel all this information into something of benefit, something world changing, or is it all just there to make money? 

We talk about what we've been learning and how. What are the pros and cons of formal and informal learning? Can we become a self directed learner? Do we need to *learn* how to learn? Do we need to change the timelines of learning? How can we make it affordable and accessible? What makes good learning resources - production quality, time, content?
